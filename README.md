# Basic Sample of a Solidity and React Project using Hardhat

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.
In the project, there is also a simple react project to read and write data from the contracts. it uses ethers.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/deploy.js
npx hardhat help
```
